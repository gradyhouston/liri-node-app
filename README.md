A Node.js app named Liri (a subtle take on Apple's Siri)

Liri is a command line node application that takes in four commands:

my-tweets: Takes no parameters. Will log the last 5 tweets from a test user account using the Twitter API.

spotify-this-song: Takes a song title and returns information about the song, artist, and album using the Spotify API.

movie-this: Takes a movie title and returns information about the movie, the actors, and year using the OMDB API.

do-what-it-says: Takes no parameters. Will call a random function among the previous three with surprise information from a random.txt file.

Built using Node.js, JavaScript, Request (NPM Package), Node-Spotify-API (NPM Package), and Twitter (NPM Package).
